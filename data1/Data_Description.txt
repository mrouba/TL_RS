Data Description:
Our dataset comprises two subsets derived from satellite images acquired by S2 and L9,
encompassing seven spectral bands (blue, green, red, near-infrared, shortwave infrared 1, shortwave infrared 2), 
along with calculated indices: NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index).
The S2 data was collected in 2023 using a single raster image, 
along with a cloud mask to detect and mask cloudy areas.
 In contrast, the L9 data was gathered over three years, from 2021 to 2023, using a series of five raster images, 
and it also incorporates a cloud mask for the identification and exclusion of cloudy regions. Each subset contains three CSV files, 
each with 10,000 samples, resulting in a total of 30,000 samples. The first file focuses on distinguishing olive-bearing land from other land types,
featuring two classes: Olive and Non-Olive. The second file targets the differentiation between palm vegetation and other land cover types,
comprising Palm and Non-Palm classes. Lastly, the third file aims to detect the presence of buildings within land sections, 
with classes labeled as Building and Non-Building. This dataset offers a valuable resource for land classification tasks, 
including land cover mapping, urban planning, and agriculture monitoring, harnessing the richness of spectral bands and computed indices
to facilitate accurate and efficient land feature classification in various applications. 

Dataset Name: '****'5000samplessentinel

File Format: CSV

Dataset Overview:
This dataset contains a total of 10,000 samples extracted from Sentinel images.
The data has been labeled into two classes: "'****'" (Class 0) and "Others" (Class 1), 
with each class consisting of 5,000 samples. 
The primary goal of this dataset is to perform a binary classification task to distinguish '****' regions from other areas in the Sentinel images.

Data Features:
The dataset comprises 6 spectral bands extracted from the Sentinel images. These bands are labeled as follows, along with their respective wavelength intervals (in nanometers):

1. Band 1 (B1) - Wavelength Interval: 435-451 nm
2. Band 2 (B2) - Wavelength Interval: 452-512 nm
3. Band 3 (B3) - Wavelength Interval: 533-590 nm
4. Band 4 (B4) - Wavelength Interval: 636-673 nm
5. Band 5 (B5) - Wavelength Interval: 851-879 nm
6. Band 7 (B7) - Wavelength Interval: 2100-2280 nm

Each sample in the dataset is represented by a feature vector consisting of the values of these 6 bands. 
These bands provide information about the reflectance at different wavelengths and are commonly used in remote sensing applications.
